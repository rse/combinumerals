FontSite CombiNumerals Ltd
==========================

This is [Ralf S. Engelschall](http://engelschall.com)'s small
kit for using Sean Cavanaugh's awesome
[FontSite](http://www.fontsite.com/)
[CombiNumerals Ltd](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/CombiNumerals-Ltd)
font on the web to conveniently render circled numbers (in the range
0-99) with the help of a CSS content generation approach. This is
especially useful to annotate lines in code blocks and then reference
those lines from within the description text.

NOTICE: This can be used for non-commercial and commercial Websites
and PDFs, but because of license restrictions on CombiNumerals Ltd it
unfortunately cannot be used for HTML5 Single-Page-Apps.

See the included [demo.html](https://cdn.rawgit.com/rse/combinumerals/master/demo.html)
for a small demonstration of CombiNumerals' possibilities.
